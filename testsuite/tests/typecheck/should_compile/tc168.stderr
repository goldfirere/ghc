tc168.hs:17:1:
    Could not deduce (C a (r, _b))
    from the context (C a (r, b))
      bound by the inferred type for ‘g’: C a (r, b) => a -> r
      at tc168.hs:17:1-16
    The type variable ‘_b’ is ambiguous
    When checking that ‘g’ has the inferred type
      g :: forall _r _b _a. C _a (_r, _b) => _a -> _r
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
