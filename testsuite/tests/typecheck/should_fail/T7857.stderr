    Could not deduce (PrintfType r0) arising from a use of ‘printf’
    from the context (PrintfArg t1)
      bound by the inferred type of g :: PrintfArg t1 => t1 -> t
      at T7857.hs:10:1-21
    The type variable ‘r0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance [safe] (a ~ ()) => PrintfType (IO a)
        -- Defined in ‘Text.Printf’
      instance [safe] (PrintfArg a, PrintfType r) => PrintfType (a -> r)
        -- Defined in ‘Text.Printf’
      instance [safe] IsChar c => PrintfType [c]
        -- Defined in ‘Text.Printf’
    In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘printf "" i’
    In the expression: f $ printf "" i
    In an equation for ‘g’: g i = f $ printf "" i
