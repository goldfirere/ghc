    Couldn't match representation of kind ‘k2’ with that of ‘*’
      ‘k2’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the type signature for withSomeSing :: Proxy kproxy
           at T8616.hs:7:17
    When matching types
      Any :: k2
      Proxy kproxy :: *
       Expected type: Proxy kproxy
         Actual type: Any
    Relevant bindings include
      withSomeSing :: Proxy kproxy (bound at T8616.hs:8:1)
    In the expression: undefined :: (Any :: k)
    In an equation for ‘withSomeSing’:
        withSomeSing = undefined :: (Any :: k)
