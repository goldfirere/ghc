    Couldn't match expected type ‘r1’ with actual type ‘r’
      ‘r’ is untouchable

      ‘r’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of go :: Thrist r2 r3 -> r -> r1 at T7438.hs:6:1
      ‘r1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of go :: Thrist r2 r3 -> r -> r1 at T7438.hs:6:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘go’
    Relevant bindings include
      acc :: r (bound at T7438.hs:6:8)
      go :: Thrist r2 r3 -> r -> r1 (bound at T7438.hs:6:1)
    In the expression: acc
    In an equation for ‘go’: go Nil acc = acc
