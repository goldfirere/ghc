    Couldn't match expected type ‘r’ with actual type ‘r1’
      ‘r1’ is untouchable

      ‘r1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of i1b :: T t -> r1 -> r at gadt7.hs:16:1
      ‘r’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of i1b :: T t -> r1 -> r at gadt7.hs:16:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    Relevant bindings include
      y1 :: r1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)
      y :: r1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:7)
      i1b :: T t -> r1 -> r (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: y1
    In a case alternative: K -> y1
