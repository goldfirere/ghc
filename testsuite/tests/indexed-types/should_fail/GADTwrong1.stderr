      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for coerce :: a -> b at GADTwrong1.hs:10:20
    Relevant bindings include
      y :: c1 (bound at GADTwrong1.hs:12:16)
      coerce :: a -> b (bound at GADTwrong1.hs:11:1)
    In the expression: y
    In a case alternative: T y -> y
